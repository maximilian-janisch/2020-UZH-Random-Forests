    "We have been assigned a multi-class classification problem, that is we are interested in correctly predicting if a given input in $\\mathcal{X} = \\mathbb{R}^d$ belongs to one of __three__ classes (i.e. $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0,1,2\\}$). We are instructed to solve this multi-class classification problem by reducing it to a sequence of binary classification problems (i.e. where $\\mathcal{Y}'=\\{0,1\\}$). We are __not__ allowed to use the multi-class implementation of sklearn and one of the models we must implement must be the random forest model. The goal of the project is then to describe and document in detail how to find and implement the best machine learning algorithm for the dataset assigned to us.\n"
